## About Me

I am a PhD student in the Department of Nuclear Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, and I am super passionate about sustainability. It is the responsibility of people today to leave a better Earth for the generations of tomorrow. My current research focuses on modeling and simulation of nuclear reactors, and I hope to eventually contribute to the development of modern, computation-based technologies to make widespread sustainable nuclear power a reality.

Before starting at Berkeley, I graduated from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 2016 with a Bachelor's degree in Physics. At UMass, I was incredibly fortunate to be a member of the third cohort of the iCons (Integrated Concentration in Science) program. iCons allowed me to augment the standard Physics curriculum with an interdisciplinary, team-based, renewable energy concentration. Just as importantly, iCons cultivated a mentality of thinking-big, and led me to consider the potential impact that sustainable, advanced nuclear energy could offer in the march towards a cleaner planet.
