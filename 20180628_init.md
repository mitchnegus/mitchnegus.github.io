###### _"In learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn."_ – Phil Collins

This past spring, I had the privilege of being the teaching assistant for the UC Berkeley upper division course on nuclear reactor theory. In the process, I realized that the wisdom I'd heard again and again was dead on. Teaching, at least for me, is the best way to learn. To stand up in front of a class and explain a concept or demonstrate a problem, I needed to know my material cold. 

I'm no psychologist, but I could make a number of guesses why this is so true. Most obviously, I spent a ton of time with the material, but I think there is more to it than that. I was prepping lessons, writing my own exercises, and grading exams. When taking a class myself, I had always been able answer a problem correctly by putting the right pieces together in the right way. Writing problem solutions took that to the next level. I needed the right pieces, but I also needed to put them together in the most intuitive order. Grading exams presented a different challenge. If I was going to tell someone else that they had the wrong answer to an exam question, I felt the responsibility to be damn sure that I knew what I was talking about. A similar thing happened when teaching. Students could and would ask questions about any point in my lecture. Without a satisfactory answer, it felt like I was losing credibility and respect–especially teaching bright college students. And, even if I could explain the problem front to back and back to front, if my students weren't getting it I needed to try a different approach, seeing the problem from all different angles. All this work came together, and by the end of the semester I found I could even create original problems off the top of my head during lectures.

About midway through the semester, I realized that this method of learning was working so well that I began to write all of my notes–for my own classes, for my research, even for my hobby projects–as if they were tutorials for an invisible audience. Explaining a concept in a way that could be understood by someone with minimal background forced me to grapple with what I was really doing. 

I'm thrilled that this fall I get to teach again, jumping out of my comfort zone and teaching an upper division statistics course. I'm going to keep documenting my work in tutorial-style entries, but now I figure I'll post it online too. My audience might still be invisible, but that doesn't mean it has to be fictional. I know there are already a lot of blogs out on the web like this, but on the off chance that you find what you're looking for here, I'm pumped that I could help you out. Let me know if you have any questions about any of the posts and I'll do my best to follow up.

Live and learn!
